This Flutter mobile application revolutionizes healthcare by offering a wide range of features, including a chatbot, login functionality, real-time doctor consultations, video calling, appointment scheduling, and an admin panel for doctors. We've learned various skills and technologies, including graphic design using Figma, while building this project.
